# An Indonesian News Sentiment Index for CPI Nowcasting (INSEI)

This project establishes a reproducible framework for native-language sentiment analysis in emerging market inflation nowcasting, aiming to overcome the latency of official CPI reports, the methodological flaw of relying on English translation, & improving from the monolithic concept of inlfation. The outcome is the **Indonesia News Sentiment of Inflation (INSEI)** index, validated as a leading indicator of Indonesia's monthly CPI rate.

## How to read the folder Code:

This project consists of multiple Jupyter Notebooks organized across several directories. To ensure the data pipeline and analysis remain consistent, please follow the execution order detailed below.

The project is structured into 5 sequential folders. Each folder represents a specific stage of the project. Within each folder, files are prefixed with a digit (1–9) to indicate the internal processing order.

## Execution Workflow

- Start with Folder 1-.
- Run notebooks in that folder from 1 to 9 (as numbered).
- Once a folder is complete, move to the next folder in numerical order (2-, then 3-, etc.).

Every notebook follows this pattern: [Step_Number]\_[Description].ipynb
